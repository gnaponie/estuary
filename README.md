## Development

To setup a development environment, make sure you have `npm` installed.

Once npm is installed:
* Run `npm install` to install the dev and production dependencies
* Run `ng serve --open` to start the development server
* Once the development server is up, your browser will open up to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Run the Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
